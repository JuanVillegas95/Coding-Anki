# Coding-Anki
Repository for practicing and reinforcing coding problems using a spaced repetition approach.

## Overview
This repository leverages Git branches to create a system for coding practice. By revisiting specific branches and commits, I can repeatedly re-implement coding exercises and run tests to solidify my understanding and improve retention. Each branch represents a different area of study or topic, and each commit represents a specific step or exercise within that topic.

## Commit Conventions
### Problems
- **Problem Commit:** `[problem] <topic>: <description>`
- **Solution Commit:** `[solution] <topic>: <description>`

### Projects
- Normal commit messages are used for projects. To view a solution, simply go one commit ahead.

### Example Workflow for Problems and Projects
#### Branch: `algorithms`
1. **Commit 1 (Problem):** `[problem] binary-search: added exercise with incomplete function`
2. **Commit 2 (Solution):** `[solution] binary-search: implemented binary search function`
#### Branch: `open-gl`
1. **Commit 1:** `set up project`
2. **Commit 2:** `create a window`
3. **Commit 3:** `draw a circle`
