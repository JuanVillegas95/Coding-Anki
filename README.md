**Coding-Anki** repository is designed to practice and reinforce my understanding of coding problems using a spaced repetition approach.

## Overview

## Structure

- **main**: Contains the README and general information about the repository.
- **solution/**: Branches with the full implementation of exercises and unit tests.
- **practice/**: Branches where the implementation is removed, keeping only the tests for practice.
