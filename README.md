# Coding-Anki

Welcome to the **Coding-Anki** repository, designed to help me practice and reinforce your understanding of data structures and algorithms using a spaced repetition approach.

## Overview

This repository leverages Git branches to create a system for coding practice. By revisiting specific branches, I can repeatedly re-implement coding exercises and run tests to solidify your understanding and improve retention.

## Structure

- **main**: Contains the README and general information about the repository.
- **solution/**: Branches with the full implementation of exercises and unit tests.
- **practice/**: Branches where the implementation is removed, keeping only the tests for practice.
